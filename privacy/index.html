This app helps a user repurpose videos from their own YouTube account into short vertical clips and upload them to TikTok.

Information We Collect
- OAuth tokens required to access the user’s YouTube and TikTok accounts (with the user’s permission).
- Basic metadata needed to select and upload videos (e.g., video title, ID).

We do not sell personal data.

How We Use Information
- To access the user’s authorized YouTube content
- To generate a short clip and convert it to a vertical format
- To upload the clip to the user’s TikTok account
- To generate captions (if enabled)

Data Storage
OAuth tokens may be stored securely to keep the app working between sessions.
We do not intentionally store video content beyond what is necessary to process and upload.

Sharing
We do not share user data with third parties except:
- YouTube / Google APIs (to access the user’s content)
- TikTok APIs (to upload content)

User Controls
Users can revoke access at any time through Google/TikTok connected apps pages.
